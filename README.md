# Trax-tutorial
simple tutorials to familiarize with TRAX library


Trax is a new library developped and maintained by Google Brain. It uses tensorflow and JAX (enhanced version of numpy).
Trax is reputed to be faster and simplier to code than predecessors due to the fact it has been developped from the ground, without the inherent retro-compatibility issues which put weight and add complexity to older frameworks like Pytorch or Tensorflow-Keras.

Trax manual can be found [here](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
